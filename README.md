###Inspiration

Inspired by Asteroids and Freelancer. Wanted to do a Freelancer like game, with harvesting ore, attacking other ships, upgrading your ship, dialogue with NPCs, etc, but wanted to start with a basic Asteroids game if nothing else.

###What it does

It's a basic asteroids type game. You can fly around your ship, the sprites wrap around when they hit an edge, you can destroy asteroids, which then break into smaller pieces, and get killed by hitting them + get a score and restart the game.

###How we built it

Pygame, Python, very quickly (A couple days to learn Python/ Pygame, a day to get the ship flying around/ fix some lower level essential movement issues, and a day to finish the rest of the game in a rush)

###Challenges we ran into

Time is the biggest one. Tried to learn the basics of Pygame, Python, how to add OO programming using it, overriding sprites to make them more what I could use quickly/ reusable. Also wanted to try to find a way to make the game playable in the browser, but didn't find a way.

###Accomplishments that we're proud of

Learning Python/ Pygame/ completing basic game. Getting asteroids working decently.

###What we learned

Python/ Pygame

###What's next for Asteroids in Pygame- rushed

Make it more like freelancer- add a larger map, have player centered in the screen, world scroll about them, add levels in JSON format, allow upgrading the ship, improve the graphics.

Would also like to test performance/ optimize code and get rid of a lot of comments. Used LibGDX before, and know it can go faster if using a texture atlas to batch up sprite rendering/ all render from the same texture.

###Built With

    pygame, python
